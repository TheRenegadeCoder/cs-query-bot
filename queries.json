        "query": "What is correctness?",
        "response": "Correctness has many definitions. However, for the purposes of this course, we define correctness as the ability of a program to behave in a way that is consistent with the contract. In other words, the set of actual outputs of a program fit within the set of all possible outputs according to the contract.",

        "query": "What is confidence building?",
        "response": "Confidence building is an approach to reasoning about a recursive algorithm. Confidence building begins by testing the recursive algorithm with the smallest problem. It then tests the recursive algorithm with the next smallest problem, and so on. By subbing in correct answers to smaller problems, we can build confidence in the recursive algorithm.",

        "query": "What is the declared type of a variable?",
        "response": "Sometimes called the static type or the compile-time type, the declared type is the type of a variable at the time it was declared. The declared type is often called the static type or compile-time type because it is the type the compiler uses to type check the program.",

    },
    {
        "query": "What is restores mode?",
        "response": "Restores mode is the default parameter mode. If a parameter is in restores mode, the method promises that the parameter will not be modified from the perspective of the client. It is okay for a method to modify the parameter, but they must always restore it before the method returns.",

    {
        "query": "What is a queue?",
        "response": "A queue is a sequence-like data structure where elements can only be added to one end and removed from another (FIFO). A common example of a queue is the line at the register of a grocery store. The first person in line is the first person to checkout. In practice, queues are often used for similar purposes, such as a queue of songs in a music player.",

        "query": "What is a stack?",
        "response": "A stack is a sequence-like data structure where elements can only be added and removed from the same end (LIFO), like a stack of papers or pancakes. Stacks are one of the most important data structures as programming languages like Java use them to store method calls. When you make too many nested method calls, you get a Stack Overflow error, meaning the program ran out of memory.",

    },
    {
        "query": "What is updates mode?",
        "response": "Updates mode is a parameter mode which describes a parameter that is to be changed to some other value. Under this mode, the initial value of the parameter matters. In this course, we indicate updates mode using the JavaDoc annotation @updates.",

    {
        "query": "What is the default parameter mode when none is specified in the method contract?",
        "response": "When no parameter mode is specified in the method contract, the default parameter mode is Restores. This means that the variable should be restored to its original value/state after the method is called.",

        "query": "What is the drawback and/or problem with aliasing?",

        "response": "A superclass is a class that is inherited from (i.e., the class name that appears to the right of the extends keyword). A subclass is a class that inherits from a parent class (i.e., a class that includes the extends keyword).",
